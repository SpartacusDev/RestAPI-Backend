# Backend for the RestAPI
This gets all the packages from the repos and adds them to the database.

## You want to add your repository to the API or remove it from the API?
Send me a message in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mZZhnRDGeg) and I will gladly take action

# Contributing
Feel free to contribute by making a pull request

# Found an issue?
Please either file an issue here in the GitHub repo (I may not see it fast, which is why I suggest the second method more, which is:) or tell me the issue in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mZZhnRDGeg)

# Credits
